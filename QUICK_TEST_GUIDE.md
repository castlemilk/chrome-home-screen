## 🎯 What to Expect

### In Settings Panel:

You'll now see **THREE** image source sections:

1. **🌥️ Cloud Images (GCS)** - NEW!
   - 16 NASA Webb images
   - Loaded from: https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-home-images/
   - Cloud icon badge
   - Fast CDN delivery

2. **🖼️ NASA Webb Images (Local)**
   - Same 16 images
   - Bundled with extension
   - Offline fallback

3. **🎨 Unsplash Photos**
   - External curated images
   - Multiple categories

### Performance:
- **First load**: ~12KB manifest download
- **Subsequent**: Instant (cached 24 hours)
- **Images**: Progressive loading with thumbnails

## 🐛 If You Still See CORS Errors

Run this command to verify CORS is set:

```bash
cd image-pipeline
gsutil cors get gs://chrome-home-images
```

Should show:
```json
[{
  "origin": ["chrome-extension://*"],
  "method": ["GET", "HEAD"],
  ...
}]
```

If not set, run:
```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://chrome-home-images
```

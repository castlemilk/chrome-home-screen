# React Grid Layout Resize Functionality Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed App.jsx Configuration
- Added `resizeHandles={['se']}` prop to explicitly enable southeast resize handles
- Kept `draggableHandle=".drag-handle"` to maintain proper drag behavior
- Both `isDraggable={editMode}` and `isResizable={editMode}` are enabled

### 2. Improved CSS for Resize Handles
- Increased z-index to 50 to ensure handles are above content
- Added `pointer-events: auto` to ensure handles are clickable
- Improved visual feedback with better opacity and hover states
- Made handles smaller (20px) but more responsive

### 3. Fixed Widget Container Styles
- Changed cursor from 'move' to 'default' to avoid confusion
- Ensured containers fill the grid item (height: 100%, width: 100%)

## How to Test

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5175

3. **Enable edit mode:**
   - Click the grid icon (Grip) in the floating action buttons
   - The UI should show edit mode indicators

4. **Add a widget:**
   - Click the plus (+) button
   - Select any widget from the marketplace
   - Close the marketplace

5. **Test resizing:**
   - Look for the resize handle in the bottom-right corner of the widget
   - It should appear as small white diagonal lines when in edit mode
   - Hover over the handle - it should become more prominent
   - Click and drag the handle to resize the widget

6. **Test dragging:**
   - Click and drag the move icon at the top of the widget to move it
   - This should work independently of resizing

### Debug Mode

To make resize handles more visible during testing:

1. Open `/src/index.css`
2. Find line 3063 and uncomment the debug background:
   ```css
   .app.edit-mode .react-grid-item > .react-resizable-handle {
     background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3) !important;
   }
   ```

This will add a red background to resize handles making them easier to see.

### Browser DevTools Inspection

1. **Inspect widget elements:**
   - Right-click on a widget → Inspect
   - Look for `.react-grid-item` wrapper
   - Check for `.react-resizable-handle` child element

2. **Verify handle properties:**
   - The resize handle should have:
     - `position: absolute`
     - `bottom: 0; right: 0`
     - `cursor: se-resize`
     - `z-index: 50`

3. **Check for conflicts:**
   - Ensure no parent elements have `pointer-events: none`
   - Verify the handle is not covered by other elements

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Widgets should be **draggable** by the move icon
- ✅ Widgets should be **resizable** by the bottom-right corner handle
- ✅ Resize handles should be **visible** in edit mode
- ✅ Resize handles should have **proper cursor** (se-resize)
- ✅ Core elements (time, greeting, search) should **only** be draggable by their handles

## Troubleshooting

### If resize handles are not visible:
- Check that edit mode is enabled
- Verify the widget is actually a `.react-grid-item`
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

### If resize handles don't work:
- Ensure the cursor changes to a resize arrow when hovering
- Check for competing CSS that might block pointer events
- Verify the `isResizable={editMode}` prop is true

### If dragging doesn't work:
- Make sure you're clicking the move icon, not the widget content
- Verify `isDraggable={editMode}` is true
- Check that `.drag-handle` elements are present

## Files Modified

1. `/src/App.jsx` - Added `resizeHandles` prop
2. `/src/index.css` - Improved resize handle styles and z-index
3. `/src/components/WidgetContainer.css` - Fixed container cursor and sizing

# Chrome Home Extension - Fixes & Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the Chrome Home Extension.

## ✅ Completed Issues

### 1. Todo Widget Persistence ✓
**Problem:** Todo items were not persisting across new tabs and would reset to defaults.

**Solution:**
- Updated `TodoWidget.jsx` to use `chrome.storage.sync` for persistence
- Added `useEffect` hooks to load todos on mount and save on every change
- Default todos are only set if no saved todos exist

**Files Modified:**
- `src/widgets/TodoWidget.jsx`

---

### 2. Widget Layout Preservation ✓
**Problem:** Adding or removing widgets would rebuild all layouts, wiping out user's custom positioning.

**Solution:**
- Modified `addWidget()` to only add layout entries for new widgets, preserving existing layouts
- Modified `removeWidget()` to only remove the specific widget's layout, not rebuild all layouts
- Changed from `rebuildLayouts()` to incremental layout updates

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.jsx` (addWidget and removeWidget functions)

---

### 3. Search Bar Alignment Issues ✓
**Problem:** Widgets would try to position alongside the search bar, causing awkward alignment on certain window sizes.

**Solution:**
- Updated `autoArrangeWidgets()` to place all widgets BELOW core UI elements (starting at y=4)
- Removed the logic that tried to place widgets alongside the search bar
- Widgets now have independent positioning from the search bar

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.jsx` (autoArrangeWidgets function)

---

### 4. Transparent Settings Modal ✓
**Problem:** Settings modal was too opaque to preview the selected background.

**Solution:**
- Reduced overlay opacity from 0.7 to 0.3
- Reduced settings container opacity from 0.85 to 0.5
- Reduced backdrop blur from 24px to 8px on overlay, 40px to 20px on container
- Lighter shadows for better transparency

**Files Modified:**
- `src/index.css` (settings-overlay and settings-container styles)

---

### 5. Image Quality Improvements ✓
**Problem:** Background images appeared pixelated.

**Solution:**
- Updated `BackgroundSelector.jsx` to use full-size or large WebP images instead of preview size
- Added CSS properties to improve image rendering:
  - `image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast`
  - `image-rendering: crisp-edges`
  - `image-rendering: high-quality`
  - Hardware acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
  - Added `backface-visibility: hidden` to prevent blurring

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/BackgroundSelector.jsx`
- `src/index.css` (background-layer styles)

---

### 6. Todo Item Drag-and-Drop ✓
**Problem:** No way to reorder todo items.

**Solution:**
- Integrated `react-sortablejs` for drag-and-drop functionality
- Added `GripVertical` icon as drag handle
- Added CSS for drag states (ghost, drag, hover)
- Items persist in new order automatically via storage

**Files Modified:**
- `src/widgets/TodoWidget.jsx`
- `src/index.css` (todo drag handle and states)

**Dependencies Used:**
- `react-sortablejs` (already in package.json)

---

### 7. Clock Widget Drag-and-Drop ✓
**Problem:** No way to reorder clock items.

**Solution:**
- Integrated `react-sortablejs` for drag-and-drop functionality
- Added `GripVertical` icon as drag handle
- Added CSS for drag states specific to clock items
- Order persists via config updates

**Files Modified:**
- `src/widgets/WorldClockWidget.jsx`
- `src/index.css` (clock drag handle and states)

---

### 8. Reactive Widget Selection ✓
**Problem:** Adding a widget would close the settings panel immediately, preventing multiple additions.

**Solution:**
- Removed automatic panel close on widget addition
- Added visual feedback: checkmark icon when widget is added
- Added "Added" badge overlay on added widgets
- Added pulse animation when widget is first added
- Widgets become non-clickable once added (cursor: not-allowed)
- Updated description to inform users they can add multiple widgets

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.jsx`
- `src/index.css` (widget-added states and animations)

---

### 9. Weather Widget Default Location ✓
**Problem:** Weather widget had no default location set.

**Solution:**
- Added geolocation API integration to detect user's current location
- Falls back to New York City (40.7128, -74.0060) if:
  - User denies location permission
  - Geolocation API fails
  - Geolocation is not supported
- Only runs once on widget initialization

**Files Modified:**
- `src/widgets/GoogleWeatherWidget.jsx`

---

### 10. Weather Widget Scrollbar ✓
**Problem:** Horizontal scrollbar was visible on the hourly forecast.

**Solution:**
- Set `scrollbar-width: none` for Firefox
- Set `display: none` on `::-webkit-scrollbar` for Chrome/Safari
- Maintained scroll functionality via mouse wheel

**Files Modified:**
- `src/index.css` (weather-hourly-scroll)
- `src/weather-expandable.css` (weather-hourly-scroll)

---

### 11. Browser Action Popup Menu ✓
**Problem:** No quick access to settings from the browser extension icon.

**Solution:**
- Created React-powered popup with modern UI
- Features:
  - Quick actions: Open New Tab, Refresh All Data
  - Settings shortcuts: Full Settings, Manage Widgets, Change Background
  - User greeting (if name is set)
  - Widget statistics display
  - Gradient background matching extension theme
- Integrated with main app via Chrome message passing
- Updated manifest.json to include popup

**Files Created:**
- `popup.html` (React mount point)
- `src/popup.jsx` (React component)
- `src/popup.css` (Popup styles)

**Files Modified:**
- `public/manifest.json` (added default_popup)
- `vite.config.js` (added popup to build inputs)
- `src/App.jsx` (added message listener)

---

### 12. JWST Image Metadata ✓
**Problem:** No information about what each JWST image shows.

**Solution:**
- Added detailed metadata for all 16 JWST images:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Distance from Earth
  - Capture date
- Created hover tooltip that displays metadata
- Tooltip appears above image with smooth animation
- Styled with semi-transparent dark background and border

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.jsx` (added metadata array and tooltip rendering)
- `src/index.css` (tooltip styles)

**Metadata Includes:**
- Tarantula Nebula, Carina Nebula, Southern Ring Nebula
- Stephan's Quintet, Webb's First Deep Field, Cosmic Cliffs
- Pillars of Creation, NGC 346, Rho Ophiuchi
- Ring Nebula, Orion Nebula, Wolf-Rayet Star
- Saturn, Phantom Galaxy, Cartwheel Galaxy, Neptune
